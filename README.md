## Swagger API documentation

The API endpoints added by this extension can be observed by bulding the Magento Swagger file in the normal way. That is, use a browser to render the URL
```text
https://your-magento-domain-name/swagger
```

The page will render the publicly accessible API endpoints. To see all the endpoints including the Aquia Commerce Manager Magento Module paths you need to enter an authorisation token in the input box on the top-right of the page.

You can get an authorization token by running
```text
curl -XPOST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' http://your-magento-domain-name/index.php/rest/V1/integration/admin/token -d '{ "username": "admin", "password": "password1" }'
``` 
With your username and password in place. Copy the returned token into the box on the /swagger page and press the `apply` button.

Please see [Magento swagger developer docs](http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.0/rest/generate-local.html) for additional information about the Magento API spec.
